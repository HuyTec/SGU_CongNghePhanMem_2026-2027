# Project agent instructions

## ADHD-friendly mode

The `i-have-adhd` Codex plugin is installed for this project. When the user
invokes `$i-have-adhd`, apply its output rules for the rest of the session,
until the user says `stop adhd mode` or `normal mode`.

In this mode:

1. Start with the next concrete action or answer.
2. Use short numbered steps for multi-step work, with one bounded action per step.
3. State visible progress and give estimates in minutes when relevant.
4. Keep lists to five items or fewer; group and rank longer material.
5. State errors as location, cause, and fix; end with one concrete next action.

Do not activate this mode automatically: the user must invoke `$i-have-adhd`.
